# Installation
#

Don't use the usual...

    brew install r

Installing R this way, it is not compatible with the CRAN package binaries.
This implies building and installing ALL packages from source. This takes
additional time during installation and can lead to more time spent dealing
with installation issues if a package fails to compile.

Instead, if you prefer the convenience of homebrew, we recommend installing the
r cask. NOTE: the cask used to be named r-app but the -app suffix was dropped
due to a homebrew policy change around 2019-03-11.

    brew install --cask r

This will install the CRAN R distribution, so all package binaries will be
available just like they would be from installing R manually.
